## Introduction

The project focuses on recognizing Kannada handwritten characters, including both alphabets and numbers, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The application aims to classify and identify Kannada handwritten characters accurately.

## Features

- Classification of Kannada handwritten characters (alphabets and numbers) using SVM
- User-friendly interface using Streamlit for testing the custom images
- Accurate and efficient recognition of handwritten characters

## Datasets

The datasets used for training and testing are crucial for the model's performance. Please download the dataset from the following URL:

[Download Dataset](https://shorturl.at/XbIvl)

**Note:** Download and place the dataset in the root directory of the project before running any scripts or notebooks.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages, listed in `requirements.txt`:

- `streamlit-drawable-canvas`
- `streamlit`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scikit-image`

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone <https://github.com/gowthamigs/kannada_rec/.git>
   - cd Kannada-Character-Recoginition

2. Install the required packages:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download and add the dataset:
